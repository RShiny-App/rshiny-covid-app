### Data on COVID-19 vaccination in the EU/EEA
The [downloadable data file](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-covid-19-vaccination-eu-eea) contains information on COVID-19 vaccination in the EU/EEA.

The data are presented in the Vaccine Tracker and collected through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). EU/EEA Member States are requested to report basic indicators (number of vaccine doses distributed by manufacturers, number of first, second, additional and unspecified doses administered) and data by target groups at national level every four weeks.

Data are subject to retrospective corrections. Corrected datasets are released every four weeks as soon as the processing of updated national data has been completed at ECDC level. You may use the data in line with ECDCâ€™s copyright policy.
